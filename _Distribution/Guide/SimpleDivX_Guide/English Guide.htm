		<strong>SimpleDivX</strong> has 9 tabs located near the top of the program, 
		each labeled with both numbers and a description. This guide will walk you 
		through the program one tab at a time.
		<BR>
		<BR>
		When you first open SimpleDivX it should look similar to the picture below:
		<h1><br>
			Tab 1: Input</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/input.png">
		<H4>Folder:</H4>
		Click the small box located off to the right and the box pictured below should 
		appear.
		<BR>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/folder.png">
		<BR>
		Select the same folder you ripped your vob files to using smartripper or 
		dvddecrypter or another ripping tool, then click ok.
		<h4>Vob Files:</h4>
		If you used the "files" tab when running smartripper you can check the "select 
		all files" box, if you used the "movie" tab or perhaps a different ripping tool 
		you should check the "select main movie" box. It's also possible to select the 
		vob-files one by one.
		<h4>Video Information:</h4>
		This box will tell you all the relevant video information about the DVD you are 
		backing up.
		<h1><br>
			Tab 2: Video</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/video.png">
		<h4>Frames/Second (fps)</h4>
		Here you select your desired *output* framerate PAL users will select 25.000, 
		while NTSC users will select 23.976 or 29.970. SimpleDivX does normally select 
		the detected framerate from the vob files.
		<h4>Auto cropping and resizing:</h4>
		Select the checkbox : "Auto cropping and resizing" to automatically find the 
		correct aspect ratio and fill in automatically the resizing and cropping 
		values.
		<h4>Output Format:</h4>
		Select an output format that suits your needs. Several popular resolutions are 
		provided, or you can select 'custom' and input your own.<br>
		<h4>Open VOB Bitstream at LBA</h4>
		(Advanced Users): Select this if you want to start the dvd movie at a specific 
		LBA.
		<h4>Range:</h4>
		Here you can input the exact amount of seconds you want encoded. This is very 
		usefull for encoding short clips and then viewing in a player to determine 
		quality.
		<h1><br>
			Tab 3: Audio</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/audio.png">
		<h4>Create Audio:</h4>
		Uncheck this box if you don't want SimpleDivX to create audio for your video 
		file.
		<h4>Audio Language:</h4>
		When the *.ifo files are also copied from the DVD, SimpleDivX will be able to 
		tell you exactly what language the selected audio stream contains.
		<h4>Audio bitrate:</h4>
		Usefull in deciding wether to compress the audio or not.
		<h4>Audio Format:</h4>
		<i>MP3: Compresses audio with MP3 format. (Stereo only)<br>
			AC3: Retains original audio quality. This can be Dolby-Digital Stereo, 5.0 or 
			5.1 channels sound. It is possible to choose 6 or 2 channels.<br>
			OGG: Compresses audio with OGG format. (NOT SUPPORTED ANYMORE)</i>
		<h4>Audio Compression kbps:</h4>
		Choose here the compression from the audio stream. For Mp3 128 / 160 kbps is 
		recommended.<br>
		When AC3 is choosen as audio format, it is possible to recompress this stream 
		with a lower bitrate. But for a 6 channel movie is it recommended that you 
		choose a minimum from 256kbps.
		<h4>Samplerate Conversion</h4>
		For Mp3 it is possible to choose 48000 or 44100khz as sample-rate. 
		Normally you would leave it to 48000 unless your sound-card cannot handle 
		48000khz.
		<h4>Amplify</h4>
		Check this to amplify the sound with some dB. It is not recommended to choose a 
		higher value then 3dB, or else you will hear some clipping of the sound in loud 
		parts.
		<h4>Peak level normalize</h4>
		When this option is enabled, the sound will be normalized to 100% (This means 
		that the loudest audio parts will be 100%, so this means no clipping.)
		<h4>Peak level normalize [midnight mode]</h4>
		When this option is enabled, the sound will be normalized to 100% and the 
		softer audio parts will be amplified some more.
		<h1><br>
			Tab 4: Codec</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/codec.png"><br>
		<br>
		<h4>1-Pass file:</h4>
		1-pass video files are created using constant bitrate, which means every frame 
		in your movie will have the exact same bitrate.
		<h4>2-Pass video file:</h4>
		2-pass movies are created using variable bitrate, which means high-motion 
		scenes get more bitrate than low motion scenes. This results in a much better 
		quality movie than 1-pass but takes roughly 2x longer to encode.
		<h4>Do Only First Pass:</h4>
		SimpleDivX will only create the first pass of the movie, when it is complete 
		you will have to come back to this tab and select 'Do Only Second Pass'. This 
		is usefull when you do only have a limited computer time available. Note that 
		2-pass modes are only available for divx and xvid.
		<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
		When you have selected "divx (mpeg4)" as codec the next screen will appear :<br>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/divx_adv.png"><br>
		<br>
		When "xvid" is selected, the next screen will appear :
		<br>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/xvid_adv.png"><br><br>
		When "h264" is selected, the next screen will appear :
		<br>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/h264_adv.png"><br>
		
		The following items are configurable :
		<h4>Global Motion Compensation:</h4>
		GMC helps in zooming and panning scenes.
		<h4>Quarter Pixel:</h4>
		Quarter pixel increases the accuracy of macro blocks within your film.
		<h4>Bidirectional Encoding:</h4>
		Can help increase compression in some scenes by using forward and backward 
		prediction of frames.
		<br>
		
		<h1><br>
			<br>
			Tab 5: Compression</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/compression.png">
		<br>
		<h4>Enter bitrate / final movie size</h4>
		Choose 'enter bitrate' if you want to enter the video-bitrate from the divx/xvid
		yourself. Choose 'enter final movie size' to let simpledivx compute the correct
		video-bitrate for xvid/divx to fit the exact size.
		<h4>Get Time From Movie:</h4>
		This feature will attempt to read the length of the movie from the .ifo/.vob files. 
		It is not always accurate however, so if it is wrong, enter the length 
		specified on the back of the DVD case.
		<h1><br>
			Tab 6: Misc</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/misc.png">
		<br>
		At this moment only subtitle options are included on this page. In the future 
		more options will be added.
		<h4>Create subtitles</h4>
		Check this to enable subtitle processing.
		<h4>Language</h4>
		Select here the subtitle languages which must be included.
		<h4>Select all languages</h4>
		Selecting this option will just select all languages present on the dvd. Click 
		again to select no language.<br>
		<br>
		<i>*Note*</i><br>
		The subtitles will be extracted using vobsub.dll, this dll creates two extra 
		files in the final directory. For viewing the subtitles you must have met the 
		following requirements :<br>
		- Make sure the two files are on the same location as the final movie and have 
		the same name. (SimpleDivX should do this for you.)<br>
		Now you have two options :<br>
		1) Download the full vobsub package from : 
		<a href="http://www.divx-digest.com/software/vobsub.html"> divx-digest </a> , now you should be able to see 
		the subtitles using any video player in windows.<br>
		2) Download and install the "Media Player Classic" from : <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli">
			sourceforge.net : guliverkli</a>, this player is from the 
		same author as vobsub and automatically includes support for subtitles.
		<h4>Movie Container Format</h4>
		Choose here the output format from the movie file. This can be :<br>
		<i>AVI</i> , This is the default format. Can be used for video+mp3 and 
		video+ac3.<br>
		<h1><br>
			Tab 7: Project</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/project.png">
		<h4>Project Name:</h4>
		Type the name from the movie you want to make. You may set project name to 
		whatever you like, most people just use the name of the movie. This will 
		automatically name most of your output files to the project name.
		<H4>Temp Folder:</H4>
		<P>This is where the temp video and logging files will be saved.
		</P>
		<h4>Output Folder:</h4>
		This is where your completed file will be put. (This can be a *.avi or a *.ogm 
		file.)
		<h4>Overwrite files:</h4>
		Select to automatically overwrite the destination files.
		<h4>Delete temp-files:</h4>
		Select this to automatically clean-up the generated temp files from SimpleDivX.
		<h4>Split Total File:</h4>
		If you are making a 2CD rip SimpleDivX can split the file for you 
		automatically.
		<h4>Split on Fade-out</h4>
		This option automatically splits on a fade-out (black-scene).
		<h4>Normal</h4>
		In this mode it is only possible to do 1 conversion at the time. (This is 
		compatibility mode with SimpleDivX 1.1)
		<h4>Batch Mode</h4>
		This enabled you to do more conversions from different movies in one SimpleDivX 
		session.
		<h1><br>
			Tab 8: Output</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/output.png"><br>
		<h4>Shutdown windows</h4>
		This option does close the current window session and shutsdown the computer. 
		Press the start button to start the video-processing
		<h4>Status Information:</h4>
		This box will keep you informed on the progress of SimpleDivX.
		<h1><br>
			Tab 9: Setup</h1>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/setup.png">
		<h4>External Program Locations:</h4>
		Click the small box off to the right and the box pictured below should appear.<br>
		<IMG alt="" src="Images/EN/program_locations.png"><br>
		Now change all four paths to where you installed the SimpleDivX/Tools folder. 
		This box is provided for users that might already have these programs somewhere 
		else on their computer, but since SimpleDivX always includes the latest 
		versions we recommend you leave the paths pointed to the SimpleDivX/Tools 
		installation folder.
		<h4>Priority Settings</h4>
		Choose here your priority settings for :<br>
		<i>- Video<br>
			- Disk<br>
		</i>(Note : Setting it to a higher value will not automatically mean that it 
		will run faster ! It's just that encoding will get more processor-cycles.
		<h4>Language</h4>
		Choose here your language.
